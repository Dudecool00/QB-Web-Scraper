# Web Scraping NFL QB Data
I used Python to create the web scraper, with the help of GeeksforGeeks and Stack Overflow to guide my work. The data comes from the 2024 NFL season, and I used ESPN to web scrape. After completion, I ran the output through Stata to create confidence intervals and averages. The goals were to predict QB stats for the 2026 season, compare them to a season from 10 years ago, and track outlier performances.
